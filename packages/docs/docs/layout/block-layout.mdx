# Block Layout

## Introduction

The block layout is used to display content in a section-based manner. Every block layout could be created by using `Grid` and `Flex` CSS Utilities.

## Examples

### Grid

The Grid is useful to separate areas by using multiple columns. The Grid has gutters by default, but depending on the purpose of use, it could be removed by adding CSS class `Grid--withoutGutter`.

#### Example

<CodeView codeText={gridBasic} />

<CodeView codeText={applicationGrid} />

### Flex

Use `Flex` for somewhere that its child elements need to be flexible space.

#### Example 1

<CodeView codeText={flexBasic} />

<CodeView codeText={applicationFlex} />

#### Example 2

The flexible items are displayed vertically, as a column.

<CodeView codeText={flexExample2} />

<CodeView codeText={flexExample22} />
