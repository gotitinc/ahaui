# Illustration Style Guidelines

## Introduction

<p className="u-textCenter">
  <img
    src={StbIllustrationIntroduction}
    className="u-maxWidthFull"
    style={{ height: 260 }}
    alt="Introduction"
  />
</p>

Create a visually appealing style that works across character, scene and spot illustrations. Illustrations should make users feel more clear in their tasks and confident to active. The illustrations should be consistent as they came from the same source— the same brand, the same voice, the same person (metaphorically, and literally look like they were illustrated by one person)—while still smoothly changing tone, depending on the audience, their task, and emotional state.

### Visual Principles

- Clarity, Efficiency, Consistency, Professional
- No gaudy or flashy, non-showbiz

### Storytelling guidelines

**Overall**

- Flat design - save time for designers, easy for animated, support SVG
- Focus on using original shapes, and light colors
- Keep it simple. Symbolism

## Sizes

### Spot illustrations

<p className="u-textCenter">
  <img
    src={StbIllustrationSpot}
    className="u-maxWidthFull"
    style={{ height: 120 }}
    alt="Spot illustrations"
  />
</p>

Spot illustrations are the simplest and most literal expression of a concept. A spot illustration is used to help showcase a small feature or explain an experience. They’re lightweight, not too busy but are there to help enhance the flow by bringing the interface to life and delighting the user.

### Spot Hero illustrations

<p className="u-textCenter">
  <img
    src={StbIllustrationSpotHero}
    className="u-maxWidthFull"
    style={{ height: 340 }}
    alt="Spot Hero illustrations"
  />
</p>

Smaller size than Hero, focus on a single vignette. These assets are perfect when you need to pack a punch with limited space. Often, they are slightly more literal representations of a single concept. Despite simplification, they still contain a small team working on or around a larger-than-life subject.

### Hero illustrations

<p className="u-textCenter">
  <img
    src={StbIllustrationHero}
    className="u-maxWidthFull"
    style={{ height: 340 }}
    alt="Hero illustrations"
  />
</p>

A hero illustration works on a larger space and allows the user to explain a feature or a scenario with a more detailed driven approach by more complex elements.

## Color palette

The color palette and other details were based on branding to look consistent and work well with product designs.

<p className="u-textCenter">
  <img
    src={StbIllustrationColor}
    className="u-maxWidthFull"
    style={{ height: 120 }}
    alt="Color palette"
  />
</p>

### General Illustrations

To avoid distracting user focus on the product design, illustrations need to keep color balance. We try to lean on our Neutral colors as much as possible, only introducing the rest of the colour palette to give the illustration balance. Neutral 40 is our most frequent colour choice. To highlight, try to use Primary color for the key elements in the illustration.

<table className="Table Table--small Table--bordered u-backgroundWhite u-textDark u-text200">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Primary color</td>
      <td>
        B300 &nbsp;
        <span className="u-textWhite" style={{ backgroundColor: "#375DE7" }}>
          #375DE7
        </span>
      </td>
      <td>15%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Secondary color</td>
      <td>
        Lighter blue &nbsp;
        <span className="u-textWhite" style={{ backgroundColor: "#96BAFF" }}>
          #96BAFF
        </span>
      </td>
      <td>15%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Neutral colors</td>
      <td>
        White &nbsp;
        <span style={{ color: "#000" }}>#FFFFFF</span>, N40 &nbsp;
        <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#DFE1E6" }}>#DFE1E6</span>, N70 &nbsp;
        <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#A5ADBA" }}>#A5ADBA</span>, N900 &nbsp;
        <span className="u-textWhite" style={{ backgroundColor: "#091E42" }}>
          #091E42
        </span>
      </td>
      <td>70%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Message Illustrations

In some cases, there are some message colors are used to add more in the illustrations which helped to make more sense and more attention for the messages.

<table className="Table Table--small Table--bordered u-backgroundWhite u-textDark u-text200">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Message colors</td>
      <td>
        R300 &nbsp;
        <span className="u-textWhite" style={{ backgroundColor: "#D0021B" }}>
          #D0021B
        </span>, Y200 &nbsp;
        <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#FFC400" }}>#FFC400</span>, G300 &nbsp;
        <span className="u-textWhite" style={{ backgroundColor: "#22A861" }}>
          #22A861
        </span>
      </td>
      <td>30%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Neutral colors</td>
      <td>
        White &nbsp;
        <span style={{ color: "#000" }}>#FFFFFF</span>, N40 &nbsp;
        <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#DFE1E6" }}>#DFE1E6</span>, N70 &nbsp;
        <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#A5ADBA" }}>#A5ADBA</span>, N900 &nbsp;
        <span className="u-textWhite" style={{ backgroundColor: "#091E42" }}>
          #091E42
        </span>
      </td>
      <td>70%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Empty State Illustrations

We only use White along with Neutral N40 and N70. We allow for the Solid Stroke option but never use any other colours.

<table className="Table Table--small Table--bordered u-backgroundWhite u-textDark u-text200">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Neutral colors</td>
      <td>
        White &nbsp;
        <span style={{ color: "#000" }}>#FFFFFF</span>, N40 &nbsp;
        <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#DFE1E6" }}>#DFE1E6</span>
      </td>
      <td>70%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p className="u-textCenter">
  <img
    src={StbIllustrationColorDoDont}
    className="u-maxWidthFull"
    style={{ height: 240 }}
    alt="illustrations"
  />
</p>

### Shapes

<p className="u-textCenter">
  <img
    src={StbIllustrationShapes}
    className="u-maxWidthFull"
    style={{ height: 240 }}
    alt="Shapes illustrations"
  />
</p>

- Using organic shapes: circle, square, rectangle, triangle.
- Flexible use of shapes to ensure that the contrast between curves and straight lines.
- Re-used the shape of the product logo for all chat illustrations.
- Shape types:
  - stroke (round) + no fill
  - non-stroke + fill

### Lines

<p className="u-textCenter">
  <img
    src={StbIllustrationStrokeBreakdown}
    className="u-maxWidthFull"
    style={{ height: 240 }}
    alt="Lines illustrations"
  />
</p>

We use a consistent default smooth brush with a 2px stroke. We also allow for 1px stroke if there are smaller details needed in a tight space. We use a rounded cap at all times to work alongside our rounded corner approach.

- Line: accent line:1.5px và basic line: 0.5px
- Stroke: accent stroke:1.5px và basic stroke: 0.5px
- Set round border : Hero size: 1.5px, Spot hero size: 1px, Spot size: 0.5px.

<p className="u-textCenter">
  <img
    src={StbIllustrationStrokeCaps}
    className="u-maxWidthFull"
    style={{ height: 240 }}
    alt="Lines illustrations"
  />
</p>

### Patterns

- Noise
- Line

## Elements

### Character style

<p className="u-textCenter">
  <img
    src={StbIllustrationHuman}
    className="u-maxWidthFull"
    style={{ height: 240 }}
    alt="Character illustrations"
  />
</p>

- Human figures not only help tell the story but also build an emotional connection between the product and the users. Characters are styled with exaggerated form by organic shapes. There are a bit over than normal anatomy in the ratio of head and body parts. (Ex: small head with succinct hairstyle, big body with long arms and legs).
- Face expressions: using line to simplify the mouth, nose, eyes and eyebrows.
- Using geometry angles to add movement and motion to the designs.

### Objects

<p className="u-textCenter">
  <img
    src={StbIllustrationObjects}
    className="u-maxWidthFull"
    style={{ height: 240 }}
    alt="Objects illustrations"
  />
</p>

**Detail:**

- Types: office objects, natural objects or animals
- In some cases, objects can be used as the main element of an illustration.

**Background**

- Background types:
  - Fill color shape
  - Decorative objects
- Using Neutral colors for background elements to add high contrast, pay more attention to the main elements.
